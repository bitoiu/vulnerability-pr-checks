# Privacy Policy

I take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

This app logs basic information about their users. This information includes, but is not limited to, GitHub handles, timestamps and repository information. Some of this information might identify specific GitHub users. It will only be possible to map a user to an individual if that individual has made their personal information public on the GitHub platform. The information is used for debugging purposes and not persisted for later use, but might be in the system for up to one week.

## Cookies

This app does not use cookies.


## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

This application does not make use of advertisement or provides its data to any third parties for processing. 


## Links to Third Party Websites

I have included links on this app for your use and reference. I am not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of Thursday the 16th of May 2019 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, users might be notified if they decide to track this repository via GitHub. No other communication will be sent out.
