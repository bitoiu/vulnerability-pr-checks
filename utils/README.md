## Generate JWT Utility

Some of the API calls used on this app are exclusive to GitHub Apps. If you want to try them out on a GraphQL client you'll need to [authenticate as a GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app). This folder contains the script from the help doc and there are .gitignore rules in place to ignore any `*.pem` file dropped into this folder.

The script has been changed to take environment variables for the `APP_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` so the source doesn't need to be edited directly. Check the documentation to install necessary dependencies before proceeding.

To run the script just execute

```bash
APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=PATH ruby gen.rb
```
