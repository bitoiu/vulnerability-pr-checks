# vulnerability-pr-checks 

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that Probot App that posts GitHub Statuses Checks based on security vulnerabilities

## Installation

Install the app at: https://vulnerability-pr-checks.herokuapp.com/

## Current limitations

- The app is by default ignoring dismissed vulnerabilities. This is an internal variable that soon needs to be a configuration on the `.github` folder.
- GitHub Security Vulnerability alerts are only indexed on the `master` branch, this means that when checking for active vulnerabilities, the app is actually only checking master. This means that if the developer acts on the vulnerabilities on the branch, the results won't change. It's recommended if using the app, that security vulnerabilities are changed on another PR and merged before the current branch under analysis. Hoping one day all the branches are indexed, but this is the reality today.
- I was lazy with the tests, sorry.
